All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.20.0] - 2023-10-4

### Added

 - formedWords method in Board class: formedWords(_str_ word, _int_ increasingCoordinate, _(int)_ firstTilePosition) -> _[str]_ words 
 - searchExtraWord method in Board class: searchExtraWord(_int_ increasingCoordinate, _(int)_ letterPosition, _str_ letter) -> _str_ word 

### Fixed

 - validNotInitialMove() method in Board Class. The method was not considering the board limits. Now it only checks the sorrounding squares if their indeces is between 0 and 14. 

## [0.19.0] - 2023-10-1

### Added

 - DictionaryConnectionFailed exception.

### Changed

 - isInDictionary() method in Dictionary class to raise DictionaryConnectionFailed exception when pyrae.dle.search_by_word() fails.

### Fixed

 - validFirstMove() method in Board Class. The method was not considering the case of one letter words as invalid moves. Now the first word must also be at least two letters long to be considered valid. 
 - validNotInitialMove() method in Board Class. The method was not considering the case of adjacent words as valid moves. Now both cases (adjacent words and using already played tiles) are considered valid moves. 
 - Board class constructor. The square corresponding to the coordinates (7, 7) was not being counted as a premium square. Now it is also a double word score square.
 - Log level of dle module used in dictionary module to not show log messages while playing the game. 

## [0.18.0] - 2023-09-26

### Added

 - repr() method in Board class.

### Changed

 - repr() method in Square class so that it only returns the content of the square (bonus or tile), not its outline.

### Fixed
 
 - putBonuses() method in Board class. Squares accesed from board with the same bonuses and in symmetrical positions were the same objects, making that changing one of them changed all. Now they all work as different objects. 

## [0.17.0] - 2023-09-25

### Added

 - repr() method in Tile, Square and Player classes for their string representation during command line execution.

## [0.14.0] - 2023-09-20

### Added

## [0.13.0] - 2023-09-18

### Added

 - data type specification in all parameters of each method. 

## [0.11.0] - 2023-09-10

### Added

 - Integration with CircleCI.

### Changed

 - wordScore now uses resetBonus after using the value of a premium square with a newly placed tile.

## [0.5.0] - 2023-08-27

### Changed

 - Board class put(_Tile_ tile, _(int, int)_ position) to putWord(_[Tile]_ newTiles, _int_ increasingCoordinate, _(_int_, _int_)_ firstTilePosition, _[Tile]_ boardTilesPositions) -> None, now adding an entire word instead of a single tile.
 - method of raising OccupiedSquare exception.

### Added

 - tile attribute in Square class: _Tile_ tile

### Changed

 - Board class attribute board type from _[[[Square, Tile]]]_ to _[[Square]]_, saving from now on the Tile objects used by players in Square class instead of Board class, for a clearer and more intuitive code.  

### Fixed

 - Board class attribute board usage in Board class methods due to the change in its definition.
